# konnected-legacy

The Konnected integration is being deprecated in April 2025, pushing users toward migration to ESPHome. However, the current legacy setup has been running perfectly stable for years—why introduce complexity and risk when what we have works flawlessly?

I've set up the Konnected integration locally, replacing the official version seamlessly without any issues. It works perfectly in Home Assistant today. I'm maintaining this local copy and will keep it updated as needed.

I'm preserving the repository here as a backup—in case the official integration gets removed before you have time to migrate. It's ready for anyone who needs it.

Why this approach?

The current setup is proven, stable, and requires zero maintenance

Migration is a lengthy, risky process with no immediate benefit

Preserving what works is more valuable than forced change
